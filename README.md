# Airline Customer Value Analysis

## Background
Air travel has developed rapidly. With the development of the times, growth in the number of customers is a significant concern considering it will directly impact profit growth. A customer who has used our airline several times feels the service is good and will tend to this service next time. But to get new customers, we must spend a lot on a campaign to attract customers. Most new customers have more to gain than lost old customers. Losing customers is more expensive than acquiring new ones. Old customers can also bring in new customers. Therefore, in this context, airline customer value is analyzed, customers are classified, and the customer loss rate is a top priority.

## Objective
Develop appropriate marketing modes for different types of customers to maximize profits.

## Research Question
How is the grouping of customers that we have?
what should we do to retain our customers?
